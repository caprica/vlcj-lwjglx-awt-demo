vlcj-lwjglx-awt-demo
====================

This small project shows how vlcj and LibVLC 4.x video engine callbacks can be used to integrate with a Java application
using the https://github.com/LWJGLX/lwjgl3-awt library.

This basically enables adding an OpenGL media player to an AWT component, making use of layouts and other normal Java UI
components.

The demo does not pretend to use best practices or idioms for OpenGL, it is rather a minimal proof-on-concept to show
how the integration could work.
